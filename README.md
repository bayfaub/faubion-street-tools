# Welcome to Faubion Street Tools! 

## Purpose

First, I have a strong interest in real estate and real estate investing and wanted to make a tool that would help me analyze rental properties before I buy.
Second, I wanted to create a technical project that accurately depicts my technical skills and would also challenge me to learn new skills.

## Disclaimer

Please ignore my poor designs and focus more on the functionality of the project. I am NOT a designer and will reskin the project when I have more time.

# Remix Framework

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
